# Object Prientated Programming Project.

## A Multi-threaded Cypher Breaker

### Aim of project:

You are required to implement a cryptanalytic API for breaking a Rail Fence cyphers.

### How to use the program:

When running this frogram from RailFence.java a menu will appear asking for user input.

The user may either: 

1.  Decrypt the given cyphertext message **OR**

2. Provide their own cyphertext for cypher breaking along with the number of rows in the cypher

### Info on the program:

The RailFence.java was provided and received a little editing. The program is run from here.

The TextScore.java was provided.

The FileParser.java takes the given file 4grams.txt and reads it into a hashmap.

The QuadGramMap.java defines the size of the pieces of text from the 4grams.java file.

The Resultable.java is the interface of the program.

The Result.java holds the getters, setters, variables and constructor for the result.
